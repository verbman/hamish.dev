Given the need to address the most harmful terrorist propaganda online, that definition should cover material that incites or solicits someone to commit, or to contribute to the commission of, terrorist offences, solicits someone to participate in activities of a terrorist group, or glorifies terrorist activities including by disseminating material depicting a terrorist attack. The definition should also include material that provides instruction on the making or use of explosives, firearms or other weapons or noxious or hazardous substances, as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) substances, or on other specific methods or techniques, including the selection of targets, for the purpose of committing or contributing to the commission of terrorist offences. Such material includes text, images, sound recordings and videos, as well as live transmissions of terrorist offences, that cause a danger of further such offences being committed. When assessing whether material constitutes terrorist content within the meaning of this Regulation, competent authorities and hosting service providers should take into account factors such as the nature and wording of statements, the context in which the statements were made and their potential to lead to harmful consequences in respect of the security and safety of persons. The fact that the material was produced by, is attributable to or is disseminated on behalf of a person, group or entity included in the Union list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts and subject to restrictive measures should constitute an important factor in the assessment.",

The obligation to preserve material for investigative or prosecutorial purposes is justified and necessary in view of the value the material could have for the purpose of disrupting or preventing terrorist activity. Therefore, the preservation of removed terrorist content for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences should also be considered to be justified.

For the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences, the required preservation of data should be limited to data that are likely to have a link with terrorist offences, and could therefore contribute to prosecuting terrorist offences or to preventing serious risks to public security.
